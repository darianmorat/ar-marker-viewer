# AR Marker Viewer

This is a simple Augmented Reality (AR) web application that uses marker-based recognition to display animated 3D models in real-time. Built with A-Frame and AR.js, this project allows users to scan a printed marker (pattern image) using their camera and view rotating 3D models.
